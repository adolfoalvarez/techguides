# CI/CD pypelines for automatic deployment of a shiny app

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
knitr::knit_engines$set("yaml")
```

It is good practice to integrate a Shiny app in a package, as then one can take full advantage of all the integrated features already established for an R package (e.g. automatic testing, `R CMD checks`, etc.).

A simple development workflow to package a Shiny app is provided by the [`golem` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/golem/index.html).

A packaged Shiny app can also take advantage of:

- Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to automate checks and ensure higher code quality and robustness;
- Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines to automate the process of deployment to a productive environment.

This guide is an illustration of how to set up CI/CD workflows on popular open source services as Travis CI and GitHub Actions for a packaged Shiny app. [ShinyCICD](https://github.com/miraisolutions/ShinyCICD) is a minimal example of a packaged Shiny app that will be used as an example throughout the guide. By [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the package and replacing the tockens with your own, you will be able to reproduce what desscribed in the following chapters.

## Generic CI/CD pipeline

Generally speaking, a CI/CD pipleline for an R package is comprised of the following steps:

- define system environment
- install R
- chaching system environment
- check out the package
- install package dependencies
- chaching dependencies
- install package
- run checks
- caching build
- deploy

Most of these steps are implemented by default in Travis CI for an R package. In GitHub Actions, on the other hand, it is currently necessary to manually specify each of them.

## Travis CI

Travis CI is an open-source continuous integration service that can be used to build and test software projects hosted on GitHub. To set up Travis CI you need to login at [https://travis-ci.com/](https://travis-ci.com/) (using your GitHub account).

To setup Travis CI in a project use:

```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_travis(ext = "com")
```

This will generate a generic `.travis.yml` file

```{yaml, eval = F}
# R for travis: see documentation at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r

language: R
cache: packages
```

As default, Travis CI runs basic package installation (including dependencies) and performs `R CMD Checks`, triggered upon any push event on the GitHub repo in the `master` branch.

```{r, eval = T, echo = F}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics("./deployment/img/ShinyCICD_travis1.png")
```

### Automatic deployment

Travis CI can be setup to automatically perform a deployment (e.g. publish a shiny app on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)) upon any push to the `master` branch.

This can be achieved by extending the `.travis.yml` file with an appropriate `deploy:` section. 

```{yaml, eval = F}
deploy:
  provider: script
  script:
  - >-
    Rscript
    -e 'account_info <- lapply(paste0("SHINYAPPS_", c("ACCOUNT", "TOKEN", "SECRET")), Sys.getenv)'
    -e 'do.call(rsconnect::setAccountInfo, account_info)'
    -e 'rsconnect::deployApp(appName = "ShinyCICD")'
  on:
    branch: master
```

where `SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT`, `SHINYAPPS_TOKEN`, `SHINYAPPS_SECRET` are [secure variables defined on Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) and referring to [tokens](https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html#deploying-applications) on shinyapps.io.

### Putting it all together

The final `yml` file would look like:

```{yaml, eval = F}
# R for travis: see documentation at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r

language: R
cache: packages

deploy:
  provider: script
  script:
  - >-
    Rscript
    -e 'account_info <- lapply(paste0("SHINYAPPS_", c("ACCOUNT", "TOKEN", "SECRET")), Sys.getenv)'
    -e 'do.call(rsconnect::setAccountInfo, account_info)'
    -e 'rsconnect::deployApp(appName = "ShinyCICD")'
  on:
    branch: master
```

As visible from the run logs, all the CI/CD pipeline steps are performed, despite only the deployment step being explicitly defined.

```{r, eval = T, echo = F}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics("./deployment/img/ShinyCICD_travis2.png")
```

## GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) is a service for completely customizable, GitHub integrated workflow, including CI and CD executions.
[Workflows](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) use `YAML` syntax and should be stored in the `.github/workflows` directory in the root of the repository.
Workflows are constituted of jobs and each job is a set of steps to perform individual tasks, e.g. commands or actions.

A workflow should have an identifying `name` and an `on` section indicating upon which event the workflow should be triggered. It should include at least one job and each job will have a set of steps fully specifying what to execute. Such steps can be a (predefined) action or a script, however, for the time being, GitHub Actions does not support a hierarchical, aggregated structure of actions. Being fully customizable, it is necessary to fully specify each step in the CI/CD pipeline explicitely.

### Action to checkout an R package

In this example the job and the workflow are both called `CI-CD` and run upon push commands and pull requests on the `master` branch, which is the default. It uses the predefined and built in action `checkout@v2` to check out the R package.

```{yaml, eval = F}
# Check on push and pull requests to master
on: [push, pull_request]

# Name of the workflow
name: CI-CD

jobs:
  CI-CD:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
```

### Steps to install the R package

To install an R package we should first take care of its dependencies. This means checking them out and making sure they are cached for future builds.

```{yaml, eval = F}
# Query and cache R package dependencies
      - name: Query dependencies
        run: |
          install.packages("remotes")
          saveRDS(remotes::dev_package_deps(dependencies = TRUE), "depends.Rds", version = 2)
        shell: Rscript {0}
      - name: Cache R packages
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ${{ env.R_LIBS_USER }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-r-${{ hashFiles('depends.Rds') }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-r-
```

Then the package can be installed

```{yaml, eval = F}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
        shell: Rscript {0}
```

### Step to perform automatic checks

This step should occur after checking out and installing the R package. It explicitely requests to run `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck`, therefore we should make sure that the package is available.

```{yaml, eval = F}
      - name: Install rcmdcheck
        run: |
          remotes::install_cran(c("rcmdcheck"))
        shell: Rscript {0}

      - name: Check package
        run: rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = "--no-manual", error_on = "warning", check_dir = "check")
        shell: Rscript {0}
```

### Automatic deployment

Adding the deployment is another step in a `CI-CD` job. In the following example it is shown how to trigger a deployment to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)). Notice that it requires the package `rsconnect` to be available.

```{yaml, eval = F}
# Install rsconnect necessary for deployment
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          remotes::install_cran(c("rsconnect"))
        shell: Rscript {0}
        
      - name: Deploy to shinyapps.io
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
        env:
          SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT }}
          SHINYAPPS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SHINYAPPS_TOKEN }}
          SHINYAPPS_SECRET: ${{ secrets.SHINYAPPS_SECRET }}
        run: |
          account_info <- lapply(paste0("SHINYAPPS_", c("ACCOUNT", "TOKEN", "SECRET")), Sys.getenv)
          do.call(rsconnect::setAccountInfo, account_info)
          rsconnect::deployApp(appName = "ShinyCICD")
        shell: Rscript {0}
```

The variables `SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT`, `SHINYAPPS_TOKEN` and `SHINYAPPS_SECRET` are tokens defined on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)) and stored on GitHub Actions as [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-variables-and-secrets-in-a-workflow).

### Putting it all together

The final `yml` file would look like:

```{yaml, eval = F}
# Check on push and pull requests to master
on: [push, pull_request]

# Name of the workflow
name: CI-CD

jobs:
  CI-CD:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master

# Query and cache R package dependencies
      - name: Query dependencies
        run: |
          install.packages("remotes")
          saveRDS(remotes::dev_package_deps(dependencies = TRUE), "depends.Rds", version = 2)
        shell: Rscript {0}
      - name: Cache R packages
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ${{ env.R_LIBS_USER }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-r-${{ hashFiles('depends.Rds') }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-r-

      - name: Install system dependencies
        env:
          RHUB_PLATFORM: linux-x86_64-ubuntu-gcc
        run: |
          Rscript -e "remotes::install_github('r-hub/sysreqs')"
          sysreqs=$(Rscript -e "cat(sysreqs::sysreq_commands('DESCRIPTION'))")
          sudo -s eval "$sysreqs"
          # rsconnect dependencies
          sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
            libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
# Install rsconnect necessary for deployment
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
          remotes::install_cran(c("rcmdcheck", "rsconnect"))
        shell: Rscript {0}

      - name: Check package
        run: rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = "--no-manual", error_on = "warning", check_dir = "check")
        shell: Rscript {0}

      - name: Deploy to shinyapps.io
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
        env:
          SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT }}
          SHINYAPPS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SHINYAPPS_TOKEN }}
          SHINYAPPS_SECRET: ${{ secrets.SHINYAPPS_SECRET }}
        run: |
          account_info <- lapply(paste0("SHINYAPPS_", c("ACCOUNT", "TOKEN", "SECRET")), Sys.getenv)
          do.call(rsconnect::setAccountInfo, account_info)
          rsconnect::deployApp(appName = "ShinyCICD")
        shell: Rscript {0}
```

As visible from the run logs, all the CI/CD pipeline steps are performed subsequently, and are identifiable by the `name` field.

```{r, eval = T, echo = F}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics("./deployment/img/ShinyCICD_githubactions1.png")
```
