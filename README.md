`techguides` is an opensource project to collect technical guidelines and best practices, and make them available as a `bookdown` website.
At Mirai Solutions we envision `techguides` as a work in progress environment where we cna share with the community some of the experience we gather in our daily work.

The current `techguides` can be viewed at [https://mirai-solutions.ch/techguides/](https://mirai-solutions.ch/techguides/){: target="_blank" }, a `bookdown` website served through `github pages`. They feature:

- best practices for `roxygen` tags, including examples.
